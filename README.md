# **Payer Tiger** (üí≤,üêÖ)

Payer Tiger is a **monetization toolkit** for [X](https://x.com) (f.k.a.
Twitter) and [Arena](https://arena.social) creators that lets them earn directly
from their content with a single click.

It uses a
[Sherry `Dynamic Action`](https://docs.sherry.social/docs/api-reference/action-types/dynamic-actions)
to transform any tweet into an interactive, on-platform paywall or tip jar,
making it fundamentally superior to the high-friction, high-fee models of
Patreon or X's own subscriptions.

## TODO

- [x] Create T3 App
- [x] Create Foundry project
- [ ] Setup Turborepo
- [ ] Update README guide to run locally
- [ ] Deploy HTTPayer servers to cloud (payer server, treasury server, avax facilitator server, demo server)

## The Problem: Creator Monetization is Broken

Creators build massive, engaged audiences on X but struggle to monetize them
directly. Existing solutions are deeply flawed:

- **High Friction:** Off-platform links to Patreon or Gumroad kill conversion
  rates by forcing users to leave the app, create new accounts, and navigate
  complex checkout flows.
- **Inflexible Models:** X Subscriptions are "all or nothing." Creators cannot
  sell access to a single article, video, or receive a one-off tip for a viral
  post.
- **Exorbitant Fees:** Platforms can take up to 30% of a creator's hard-earned
  income, and traditional payment processors add their own fees on top.
- **Global Barriers:** Payouts are tied to traditional banking systems like
  Stripe, creating barriers for creators in many countries.

## The Solution: The Monetization Trigger

Payer Tiger gives power back to the creator. It's a lean, powerful, and open
tool that provides a simple "trigger" they can attach to any piece of content.
This trigger handles all the complexity of crypto payments, making the
experience seamless for their followers.

### How It Works

1. **Creator Sets a Trigger:** A creator posts a teaser of their content (e.g.,
   the first paragraph of an article) and attaches a Payer Tiger action: "Unlock
   Full Article for 1 USDC".
2. **Follower Clicks:** A follower clicks the button directly within the
   Sherry-embedded tweet.
3. **Server-Side Logic:** The Sherry `Dynamic Action` calls our backend API
   endpoint. Our server checks the creator's preferences (e.g., they want to
   receive funds on Celo).
4. **Optimal Transaction:** The server constructs the optimal transaction. If
   the follower is paying from Avalanche, it builds a transaction that routes
   their USDC through Wormhole to the creator's Celo wallet. If they're both on
   the same chain, it's a simple transfer.
5. **Seamless Execution:** The server returns the serialized transaction to the
   user's wallet for a single, simple signature. The follower never has to think
   about bridges or networks.
6. **Content Unlocked:** Upon confirmation, the content is instantly revealed to
   the user, all without ever leaving Twitter.
